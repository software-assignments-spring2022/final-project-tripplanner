# TripPlanner
*The TripPlanner app aims to generate trip plans based on user inputs. The user inputs will include dates, preferred locations, and optionally the user is able to put preferences for activities (e.g. sightseeing, going to restaurants, nightlife etc.) It will then enable users to modify or save the generated results.*

# Project Origins
The inspiration of this project arises from the fact that it's time-consuming for people to plan trips themselves. To make an interesting and memorable trip, one would have to do vast research on local hotels, tourist attractions , restaurants, etc. With the goal of exempting people from such trouble, the Trip Planner app aims to generate trips based on users' preferences, saving their time while catering to their needs.
